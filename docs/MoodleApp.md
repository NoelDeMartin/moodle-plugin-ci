In order to test plugins with mobile support, the only command that needs a special configuration is `behat`.

In practice, you only need to set the `MOODLE_APP` env variable to `true`, and all the dependencies will be configured during the `install` command. You can also configure the behaviour of [Acceptance testing for the Moodle App](https://moodledev.io/general/app/development/testing/acceptance-testing) using the following env variables:

- `MOODLE_APP_DOCKER_IMAGE`: Tag of [the Moodle App Docker image](https://moodledev.io/general/app/development/setup/docker-images) to use for running the app. The default value is `moodlehq/moodleapp:latest-test`.
- `MOODLE_APP_BEHAT_PLUGIN_PROJECT`: Project in github to use for installing the plugin with Behat steps specific to the Moodle App. The default value is `moodlehq/moodle-local_moodleappbehat`. This variable will be ignored if `MOODLE_APP_BEHAT_PLUGIN_REPOSITORY` is set.
- `MOODLE_APP_BEHAT_PLUGIN_REPOSITORY`: Repository url to use for installing the plugin with Behat steps specific to the Moodle App. By default, the github repository defined in `MOODLE_APP_BEHAT_PLUGIN_PROJECT` will be used.
- `MOODLE_APP_BEHAT_PLUGIN_BRANCH`: Branch of the repository to use for installing the plugin with Behat steps specific to the Moodle App. The default value is `latest`.
- `MOODLE_BEHAT_IONIC_WWWROOT`: Value to use in `$CFG->behat_ionic_wwwroot`. The default value is `http://localhost:8100`. This value should only be used if `MOODLE_APP` is not set, and the Moodle App dependencies are configured manually.

Finally, keep in mind that mobile tests only run on chrome device, so make sure to use it with the `--profile` flag.

For a specific examples, look at the [gha.dist.yml](GHAFileExplained.md) or [.travis.dist.yml](TravisFileExplained.md) files, and uncomment the lines mentioning the app.

**Important:** Please notice that `MOODLE_APP` only works starting with version 4.1 of the app. If you want to use this setup against older versions, you'll have to use `MOODLE_BEHAT_IONIC_WWWROOT` and configure the dependencies manually (installing the plugin, launching the docker image, etc.).
